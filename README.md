# full-stack projects(server and database)

# React Js based projects

# MongoDb used for database

# project Description:
# services and reviews are dynamic loaded from database.
# From dashboard, only admin can add more service, delete an service, handle order status also. 
# And only an user can add service to his/her checkout and for the payment part we use stripe.
# Also an user can show all his/her orders list and order status(which are handled by admin)

# Routes are private without home page. So you have to log in. And for log in system I used Google Sign In method with   firebase.


# I added slider below the navbar with interval.

# Also I added onMouse Effect to change the picture of that part.. those picture are different from slider image.
# Extra feature I added If a user click on dashboard, then it will redirect to log in page , after log in it will show all the services.

# Also I added spinner Before the service list.
